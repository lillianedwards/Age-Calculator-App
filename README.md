# Age-Calculator-App

It's often fun to know exactly how old you are, in months and days. How many more days until your next trip around the sun? It can also be fun to know this about others, friends, families and pets! Simply input your, or another's, birthday in the input fields and click submit. The person's age will be displayed in years, months and days. For example, on November 30 my cat was 1 year, 3 months, and 16 days old. 🐈‍  I built this app in React with custom CSS. 

## Installation 🖥️
 To install the age calculator app on your local environment clone the github repo and run "npm i" to install dependencies.

## Credits 💳
I worked on the project alone but received the design from Frontend Mentor. 

## Challenges 🏔️
I had trouble adding in the horizontal line that is placed under the input fields adjacent to the button. I also used span in a new way than I had in prior projects to display the result numbers for day, month and year. Lastly, the alignment of the invalid messages was a little tricky to test having to figure out different days, months and years that would deliver an invalid alert across all fields of just one of them. 

## Successes 👍🏼
I learned what caret-color was through this challenge! I had never looked at changing that element of a text field in prior projects. I also felt like my FlexBox use was intentional and effective in this application. Lastly, getting the irregular border radius of the application container as close as I could to the design images without having access to the Figma design files is something I'm proud of.
